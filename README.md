This repo is for the final submission for the "All Learners Capstone Project" of the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) HarvardX PH125.9x, which is the last of a series of courses comprising its Data Science Program. Detailed information of the project can be obtained from the overview section of the course, and below is a summary.

In short, we have to build a movie recommendation system from the given dataset called "movielens" which can be extracted from the dslabs R package. Upon processing the dataset into a training and a test set, we are required to use the training set to develop an algorithm to reduce the estimation error, measured in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), in the final test. 

This submission consists of three files:

1. The report in Rmd format
2. The report in PDF format
3. A script in R format that generates the predicted movie ratings and RMSE score.
